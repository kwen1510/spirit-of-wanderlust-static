      "Charlie, seize the Spirit Ash; its veil is our only shadow.",
      "Hold the Spirit Ash close—one spark, and the ship disappears from danger.",
      "Feed the Spirit Ash to the wind; without it, every lookout will spot us.",
      "Guard that dust like life itself—no Spirit Ash, no escape.",
      "Use the Spirit Ash when night falls; its glow hides more than darkness ever could.",
      "Charlie, if the cloak fails, Leo won’t hold back—he’ll call you the one who left us in the open.",
      "Spill that vial and Wally will howl your name as the reason arrows find us.",
      "Trade the Spirit Ash for comfort, and Luca will carve ‘traitor’ into your story.",
      "Lose a single grain and the others will count every ember against you.",
      "If the ship shows up on enemy sight, remember—you let the Spirit Ash slip away."

    "wally": [
      "Wally, stack the Moonwood—our engines breathe only this wood.",
      "Moonwood burns steady in any storm; load every log aboard.",
      "Keep each Moonwood; one missing, and the furnace coughs to a stop.",
      "Carry Moonwood now—no fuel, no voyage.",
      "Leave a log behind and Charlie’s fire will sputter—he’ll blame you first.",
      "Dump that Moonwood, and Leo will roar that the wolf fed the sea.",
      "Trade Moonwood for trinkets? Luca will list every crack you caused.",
      "If the ship stalls, the pack will remember whose paws dropped the wood.",
      "One weak plank, Wally, and we all stay to rot—your name on the decay."

    "leo": [
      "Leo, grab the Storm-Iron; it keeps the hull from snapping.",
      "Iron first, bravery second—both are yours.",
      "Reach for StormIron first, Lion—nothing else can brace the hull against the ocean’s bite.",
      "Seal every seam with iron; waves respect steel.",
      "Choose the Storm-Iron—no iron, no safe passage.",
      "Hesitate, and Luca will say the lion’s roar is hollow metal.",
      "Lose one bolt and Charlie’s flames will carve your failure into the deck.",
      "If you melt the Storm-Iron for coin, you purchase nothing but your own sinking.",
      "Melt a bar for coin? Wally will call you king of rust.",
      "Skip the iron, Leo, and the first wave will crown you coward."

    "luca": [
      "Luca, take the Coral Runes—without them, the helm is blind.",
      "Fit each Coral Rune; they whisper direction into the ship’s heart.",
      "Guard those Coral Runes—one lost glyph, and we drift aimless.",
      "Coral Runes first, speed later—steer us true.",
      "Slide the Cora Runes into the console; no code, no control.",
      "Drop a Coral Rune, and Wally will count every wrong turn on your head.",
      "Trade a Coral Rune, and Leo will roar you ride fast but think slow.",
      "Lose one Coral Rune and Charlie’s fire guides nothing—he’ll blame you for the darkness.",
      "If the helm freezes, the crew will glare at the rider who forgo the Coral Runes.",
      "No Coral Runes, Luca? Then prepare to circle this island forever—your circle, your fault."
